    Microsoft Fabric Data Warehouse dialect that inherits from T-SQL.

    Microsoft Fabric is a cloud-based analytics platform that provides a unified
    data warehouse experience. While it shares much of T-SQL's syntax, it has
    specific differences and limitations that this dialect addresses.

    Key differences from T-SQL:
    - Case-sensitive identifiers (unlike T-SQL which is case-insensitive)
    - Limited data type support with mappings to supported alternatives
    - Temporal types (DATETIME2, DATETIMEOFFSET, TIME) limited to 6 digits precision
    - Certain legacy types (MONEY, SMALLMONEY, etc.) are not supported
    - Unicode types (NCHAR, NVARCHAR) are mapped to non-unicode equivalents
